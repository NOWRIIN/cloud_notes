👉Cloud Notes & AWS Lab Troubleshooting

This repository contains my personal notes, fixes, and explanations from my Cloud Computing and Computer Networking coursework at BMCC. I created this while learning AWS services hands-on and building a solid foundation for cloud security.

📌 Topics I’m documenting here:

EC2 setup & connection steps

SSH key troubleshooting

IAM users & permissions

VPC basics (subnets, routing, security groups)

S3 basics

Common errors I fixed during labs

Commands and explanations in simple language

🧩 Why I Created This

I learn best by writing things in my own words, especially when I’m working through hands-on labs. Making clear notes helps me understand concepts faster, remember commands, and solve problems more confidently.

This repository is simply a place for me to organize what I’m learning, track my progress, and refer back to it whenever I need a reminder.

✔️ Status: Work in Progress

I’m still learning, and this repo will evolve as I build more skills.
